# The-Town

Resources for the Merveilles Town instance.

## Invite Only

We want to keep the instance small, the aim of the town is to facilitate a discussion on the various projects created by members of the Merveilles community. To cover for hosting and maintenance, we request a [5$ fee](https://ko-fi/somnius) to allow for Somnius to dedicate time making sure the instance is working.
