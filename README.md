# The-Town

Resources for the [Town of Merveilles](https://merveilles.town).

## Invite Only

We want to keep the instance small, the aim of the Town is to facilitate a discussion on the various projects created by members of the Merveilles community. To cover for hosting and maintenance, we making suggest [a donation](https://ko-fi.com/somnius), to allow for [Somnius](https://merveilles.town/@somnius) to dedicate time to keeping the instance working. Any surplus will be used to improve the platform and give back to the underlying projects.
