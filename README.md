# The-Town

Resources for the Merveilles Town instance.

## Invite Only

We want to keep the instance small, the aim of the town is to facilitate a discussion on the various projects created by members of the Merveilles community. To cover for hosting and maintenance, we request a 5$ from anyone to allow for Somnius to dedicate time making sure the instance is working.

## Rules

- Black and White avatars.
